#A Collection of Works in Python.
In this Replit Repo, I have configuired GIT so my changes will be seen there. To see my changes, you can simply click Tools, and then Git.
(The Code is in main.py)
Edit: All you have to do is download main.py, or the entire repo, run it and you will be given a search tool in the console itself. You can run all code from there.
